# Module 7 | Assignment - Employee Database

## Overview of Project

## Purpose
    The purpose of this analysis is to summarize employee data in order to better visualize employee metrics by age, title, and active employment.

## Results
- The vast majority of employees born between 1952 and 1955 hold senior titles at the company. This is a logical trend as these employees have been at the company longer and would be expected to climb the ranks during their tenure.
- Surprisingly, of all employees born between 1952 and 1955, 7,636 employees have a "Staff" title and only 2 employees have a "Manager" title. Although there are surely much more "Staff" positions than "Manager" positions available, the disparity is still quite large.
- Of the employees born in 1965, there is a much higher proportion of employees with an "Engineer" title than employees with a "Senior Engineer" title.
- However, of the employees born in 1965, there is a much higher proportion of employees with an "Senior Staff" title than employees with a "Staff" title.

## Summary
The "silver tsunami" will make a significant impact at Pewlett Hackard because of the employees born between 1952 and 1955, there is a large proportion of employees with senior titles. Once these employees retire, there will be a shortage of employees in senior positions. By removing the birth date filter on the Retirement Titles table, we will be able to see the titles of all employees, regardless of birth date. Then, if we filter this table to only include active employees, and further group this table by title, we will be able to see the count of all active employees by title. By doing so, we can see that of all active employees, there is a much larger overall proportion of senior engineers & senior staff to engineers & staff. Thus, in anticipation of the silver tsunami, Pewlett Hackard must begin actively recruiting senior engineers & senior staff to backfill their retiring employees.
